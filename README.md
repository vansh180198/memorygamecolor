Color Matching Game ðŸŽ¨
A fun color-matching game built using React, where players match pairs of colors. This project is a great example of using React hooks, state management, and conditional rendering to create an interactive user interface.

Features âœ¨
Randomized Grid: The color grid is shuffled at the start and reset.
Color Matching: Players click on cells to reveal their colors and match pairs.
Victory Condition: The game congratulates the player when all pairs are matched.
Reset Button: Resets the game with a shuffled grid and all cells hidden.
